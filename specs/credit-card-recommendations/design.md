# Design Document

## Overview

The Credit Card Recommendation System is a full-stack web application designed for individual consumers to provide personalized credit card recommendations through intelligent analysis of user spending patterns. The system targets consumers who actively use credit cards and want to maximize their financial benefits through strategic card selection and usage optimization. The system consists of a React-based frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and integrates with the RecEngine ML service and financial data providers to deliver real-time insights and optimization suggestions.

The architecture follows a microservices-inspired approach with clear separation between user management, recommendation engine, financial data processing, and notification services. The system prioritizes security, scalability, and real-time performance to handle financial data processing and deliver timely recommendations.

#### 1. Trigger Classifier

**Purpose:** Determines whether a transaction warrants a "which card to use" suggestion

**Model Type:** Binary Classification (Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting)

**Input Features:**

- Transaction amount and category
- User's current card portfolio
- Historical spending patterns
- Time of transaction (seasonal patterns)
- Merchant type and location

**Output:**

- `recommend_flag` (0/1): Whether to show recommendation
- `extra_reward`: Potential additional reward amount
- `confidence_score`: Model confidence in the prediction

**Training Data:** Kaggle Credit Card Transactions Dataset + synthetic user interaction data

#### 2. Reward Estimator

**Purpose:** Calculates potential annual reward increase from card optimization

**Model Type:** Regression model or hybrid rule-based calculation

**Input Features:**

- User's annual spending by category
- Current card reward rates
- Candidate card reward structures
- Annual fees and terms

**Output:**

- `Î”reward_per_year`: Projected annual reward increase
- `payback_period`: Time to recover annual fee
- `category_breakdown`: Reward increase by spending category

**Calculation Logic:**

```python
def estimate_reward_delta(user_spending, current_cards, candidate_card):
    current_rewards = calculate_current_rewards(user_spending, current_cards)
    optimized_rewards = calculate_optimized_rewards(user_spending, candidate_card)
    return optimized_rewards - current_rewards - candidate_card.annual_fee
```

#### 3. Optimizer/Action Selector

**Purpose:** Provides strategic card portfolio recommendations ("add new" vs "replace existing")

**Model Type:** Ranking Model (LightGBM Ranker or Pairwise Ranking)

**Input Features:**

- User's complete card portfolio
- Spending distribution across categories
- Card utilization patterns
- Credit profile indicators
- Market card offerings

**Output:**

- Ranked list of card recommendations
- Action type: `ADD_NEW`, `REPLACE_EXISTING`, `UPGRADE_CURRENT`
- Justification for each recommendation
- Portfolio optimization score

#### 4. Personalized Ranker

**Purpose:** Orders top N cards for homepage display based on individual preferences

**Model Type:** Collaborative Filtering + Learning-to-Rank (CF + LTR)

**Input Features:**

- User demographic and behavioral features
- Similar user preferences (collaborative filtering)
- Card features and market positioning
- Seasonal and trending factors
- User interaction history

**Output:**

- Top N ranked cards with personalization scores
- Diversity-adjusted rankings
- Contextual messaging for each recommendation

### Database Schema Design

#### Key Tables

- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `user_preferences` - User settings and preferences
- `credit_cards` - Card database with reward structures
- `user_cards` - User's current card portfolio
- `transactions` - Spending history and categorization
- `recommendations` - Generated recommendations and tracking
- `notification_history` - Sent notifications and user responses
- `analytics_cache` - Cached analytics calculations

#### Relationships

- Users have many UserCards (current portfolio)
- Users have many Transactions (spending history)
- Users have many Recommendations (personalized suggestions)
- CreditCards have many RewardStructures (earning rates)
- Transactions belong to SpendingCategories (for analysis)

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling

- **Network Errors:** Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Authentication Errors:** Automatic redirect to login with session restoration
- **Data Loading Errors:** Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messages
- **Form Validation:** Real-time validation with clear error messaging

### Backend Error Handling

- **API Errors:** Structured error responses with error codes and messages
- **Database Errors:** Connection pooling with automatic retry and failover
- **External API Errors:** Circuit breaker pattern for financial data provider failures
- **Authentication Errors:** Secure error responses that don't leak sensitive information

### Error Response Format

```typescript
interface ApiError {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

### Critical Error Scenarios

1. **Financial Data Provider Outage:** Fallback to cached data with staleness indicators
2. **Database Connection Loss:** Graceful degradation with read-only mode
3. **Recommendation Engine Failure:** Default to popular cards with generic messaging
4. **Authentication Service Issues:** Temporary guest mode with limited functionality
